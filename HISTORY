2005-03-03: version 0.4.2

- fixes for double-high characters, scaling and localization
  (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg for his patch edition)
- adapted to VDR API >= 1.3.18, reentrancy fixes

  key bindings (thanks to Peter Bieringer for pointing this out)

  now resets the cursor by one position, other keys stop
  entering of page number

2004-06-18: version 0.4

- ported to VDR 1.3/1.4 series (>=1.3.8 now required)
  This mostly involved changes in the OSD graphics code,
- now supports OSDs with color depth of 3 
  (thanks to Sascha Volkenandt)
- rewrote the storage system:
  - cache directory is now configurable (option -d)
    Default value is still /vtx to allow seamless migration,
    but /tmp/vtx is recommended (conforms to LSB etc.)
  - changed the default file format: Now more than one
    page is stored in one file. On filesystems that depend
    on a blocksize the increases storage efficiency.
    For tmpfs the improvement factor is approx. 4.
  - The old system is still available via a
    command line option (though it now uses a slightly
    different naming)
  - when no more space is available on disk
    or a specified number of harddisk space is exceeded
    (option -n) the folder least recently modified
    will be deleted.
    On exit, all files will be deleted, i.e.
    (!) on exit, all files with suffix .vtx
    below the storage directory will be deleted
  - the option -r is now obsolete (will be ignored)
    option -R/--no-receive is deprecated
- code cleanups, removed broken or unused code
- fixed quite a few bugs
- Added Russian translation (thanks to Vyacheslav Dikonov)

2003-12-2: version 0.3.2

  time spent in Receive() function, thus delaying VDR's
  receiver thread (several people reported problems
  with bitstreamout - thanks to Christian Jacobsen
  and Dr. Werner Fink)
- fixed and improved the newly introduced receiver thread
  (thanks to Dr. Werner Fink)
- fixed a bug that if there is a double high title on a page,
  the last line on that page will be missing
  (fixed by Rolf Ahrenberg)
- fixed Finnish translation (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg)
- added Italian translation (thanks to "kikko77")

  channel (thanks to Dietmar Hilbrich)

  and last page (as VDR does it with channels)
- fixed autosuspend thread

2003-04-03: version 0.3

- fixed two serious memory leaks, thanks to Martin Pley
- added feature to automatically update the page if it changed.
- moved color definitions to colormapping.h

  mechanism as VDR
- made setup menu items dynamic, i.e. the "Page Number" entries are hidden
  when "Jump to..." is not selected
- Experimental: added option to suspend the receiving automatically
  for 5min after 30s. This may enable you to use your TV set's 
  teletext decoder if you like to. (patch to VDR needed)

  respectively reenable it

  you configured in the setup and black

- Copied code to receive and save teletext data from original teletext plugin.
  (appreciating Peter Seyringer's great work)

  For each key you can choose between the three actions "Zoom", "Half page" or
  "Switch channel" or use it to jump to a page

  (0...255, VDR's default value being 127)
- included Emil Naepflein's patch to improve changing pages relatively
